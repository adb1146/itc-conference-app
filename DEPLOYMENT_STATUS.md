# ITC Conference App - Deployment Status

## ✅ Latest Fix Deployed
**Date:** September 16, 2025
**Commit:** 31c7e34 - Fix speaker profile fetch by calling Anthropic API directly

## What Was Fixed
The speaker profile "Update Profile" feature was failing in production with connection errors. The issue was caused by the API route trying to make internal fetch calls that don't work in production Next.js deployments.

### Solution Implemented
- Refactored `/app/api/speakers/[id]/fetch-profile/route.ts` to call Anthropic API directly
- Removed all internal fetch calls and module imports
- Implemented direct HTTP calls to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`
- Uses the `web_search_20250305` tool for profile research
- Maintains all existing formatting and data processing logic

## Required Environment Variables in Vercel
Ensure these are set in your Vercel project settings:

```bash
# Required for speaker profile updates
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key

# Database connection
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_url

# NextAuth (for authentication)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_32_character_secret

# Optional AI features
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key
PINECONE_INDEX=itc-sessions
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Deployment Status**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Verify the latest deployment completed successfully
   - Check the build logs for any errors

2. **Test Speaker Profile Update**
   - Navigate to any speaker detail page
   - Click the "Update Profile" button
   - Verify it shows "Updating profile..." message
   - Check that profile data updates with LinkedIn and company information

3. **Monitor Logs**
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to Functions tab
   - Look for `speakers-[id]-fetch-profile` function
   - Check execution logs for any errors

## Troubleshooting

### If "Update Profile" Still Doesn't Work:
1. Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in Vercel environment variables
2. Check function logs for specific error messages
3. Ensure the API key has proper permissions for web search

### Common Issues:
- **No Update:** Check if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is configured
- **Mock Data:** API key is missing, showing fallback data
- **API Errors:** Check Anthropic API status and key validity

## Next Steps
- Monitor the production deployment for successful profile updates
- Verify all 187 speakers can have their profiles enriched
- Consider adding rate limiting for API calls
- Add error notification system for failed updates
