# Testing the Complete Research Agent â†’ Smart Agenda â†’ Registration Flow

## Overview
This document describes how to test the complete conversational flow from guest user to registered user with saved agenda.

## Prerequisites
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Ensure database is running:
   ```bash
   # Check if PostgreSQL is running
   docker ps | grep postgres
   ```

## Test Flow

### Phase 1: Research Agent Activation

**User Message 1:**
```
"Build me a personalized agenda for the conference"
```

**Expected Response:**
- AI should recognize guest user
- Offer to research background OR
- Ask for basic information to personalize

**Alternative Triggers:**
- "I want a personalized agenda with research"
- "Create my conference schedule"
- "Build me an agenda based on my background"

### Phase 2: Information Collection

The agent should ask for:

**User Message 2 (Name):**
```
"I'm John Smith"
```

**User Message 3 (Company):**
```
"I work at Acme Insurance"
```

**User Message 4 (Role):**
```
"I'm the VP of Innovation"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Sequential questions
- Natural conversation flow
- Context preservation

### Phase 3: Research Simulation

**Expected Response After Info Collection:**
```
"Let me research your background to personalize your conference experience..."
```

The agent should:
- Perform mock research (using mock data in development)
- Present findings
- Ask for confirmation

### Phase 4: Agenda Generation

**User Message 5:**
```
"Yes, that looks good. Build my agenda"
```

**Expected Response:**
- Personalized agenda with sessions
- Based on research findings
- Formatted with session details

### Phase 5: Save Offer

**After Agenda Generation:**
The system should automatically offer:
```
ðŸ”’ Would you like to save this agenda to your profile?

I can help you create a free account right here in the chat to:
â€¢ Save all X selected sessions
â€¢ Get reminders before sessions start
â€¢ Export to your calendar
â€¢ Access from any device

Just say "yes" to save your agenda
```

### Phase 6: In-Chat Registration

**User Message 6:**
```
"Yes, I'd like to save it"
```

**Registration Flow:**

1. **Email Collection:**
   - User: "john.smith@acme.com"

2. **Password Creation:**
   - User: "SecurePass123"

3. **Password Confirmation:**
   - User: "SecurePass123"

4. **Name Confirmation:**
   - Already collected, might skip or confirm

5. **Company Confirmation:**
   - Already collected, might skip or confirm

6. **Role Confirmation:**
   - Already collected, might skip or confirm

7. **Interest Selection:**
   - User: "1, 3, 5" (selecting from numbered list)

### Phase 7: Account Creation & Agenda Save

**Expected Final Response:**
```
âœ… Account created successfully!

ðŸŽ¯ I've saved your personalized agenda with X sessions to your profile.

You can now:
â€¢ View your saved sessions in the Favorites section
â€¢ Export your schedule to your calendar
â€¢ Get personalized recommendations
â€¢ Access your agenda from any device
```

## Testing with cURL

### Test Complete Flow:
```bash
# Set session ID
SESSION="test_$(date +%s)"

# Step 1: Initial request
curl -X POST http://localhost:3011/api/chat/stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"message\": \"Build me a personalized agenda\",
    \"sessionId\": \"$SESSION\",
    \"userPreferences\": {}
  }"

# Step 2: Provide name
curl -X POST http://localhost:3011/api/chat/stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"message\": \"I am John Smith\",
    \"sessionId\": \"$SESSION\",
    \"userPreferences\": {}
  }"

# Continue with remaining steps...
```

## Debugging

### Check Logs
Look for these log messages in the console:

1. `[Stream API] Detected research request from guest user`
2. `[Stream API] Continuing research agent conversation`
3. `[ProfileAgent] Starting research for: John Smith`
4. `[Stream API] User wants to save agenda, starting registration`
5. `[Stream API] Registration in progress, handling registration flow`
6. `[RegistrationHandler] Account creation successful`

### Common Issues

1. **Research Agent Not Triggering:**
   - Check if message contains trigger keywords
   - Verify user is not authenticated
   - Check conversation state

2. **Registration Not Starting:**
   - Ensure agenda was generated first
   - Check if pendingAgenda is stored
   - Verify "yes" response is detected

3. **Account Creation Failing:**
   - Check database connection
   - Verify email uniqueness
   - Check password requirements

## Database Verification

After successful flow, verify in database:

```sql
-- Check user was created
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john.smith@acme.com';

-- Check favorites were saved
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM favorites
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'john.smith@acme.com');

-- Check user metadata
SELECT metadata FROM users WHERE email = 'john.smith@acme.com';
```

## Expected Data Flow

1. **ConversationState** tracks:
   - researchAgentActive
   - pendingAgenda
   - registrationInProgress
   - registrationStep

2. **Session Storage** maintains:
   - User responses
   - Generated agenda
   - Registration data (temporarily)

3. **Database** stores:
   - User account
   - Favorite sessions
   - Agenda metadata

## Success Criteria

âœ… Guest user can trigger research agent
âœ… Information collected conversationally
âœ… Research performed (or simulated)
âœ… Agenda generated based on profile
âœ… Save offer presented
âœ… Registration completed in chat
âœ… Account created successfully
âœ… Agenda saved to favorites
âœ… User can access saved sessions

## Notes

- In development, research uses mock data
- Real web search requires API keys
- Registration is atomic - all or nothing
- Agenda persists for 24 hours if not saved
- Session continuity maintained throughout
